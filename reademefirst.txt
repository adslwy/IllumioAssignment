To start the REST API, 
1. first you need to run: npm --install under the base directory to install all the dependency. 
2. still under the base directory run: npm --test to run the test case
3. go into ./bin/ directory, run node www to start the server. Then you can open postman to test the REST API.
4. to test the API under Postman, first you need to register a user at baseURL + /users/register, then login at baseURL + /users/login. After that copy the token from login return message and paste it into the header, set the key to 'x-access-token', value to 'token'. Then you can do CRUD to the secrets.
